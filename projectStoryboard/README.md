Some things to consider for Milestone 3:
There is currently no cancel button for the Speech to Text View, the only way back to the pantry is to save a recording.

After you use Speech to Text to input a new ingredient to your pantry, we hard code an expiration date of 2 weeks after the current time...we need to ask you about a good way to gather some of this informaiton from the user.

The recipes are currently generated by hard coded ingredients (apples and peanut butter), but we just have to do a little more work parsing our ingredients' names and substituting them to our API call to get the recipes. The capability is there, but the final functionality is not.

The recipe options view currently does nothing in terms of filtering the recipes, but it will make a call very similar to the one that is currently used to create and populate the table of recipes.
